This is some text before a section. It shouldn't be indented.

# This is a section

This is some test text. This is formatted in *italics* and **bold**,
with - various -- dashes---, and trailing dots...

'These quotes should be curly,' and "so should these." There should be a
blank line before the next paragraph:

 

And then there should be some text ^in superscript^ and ~in subscript~,
and a footnote[^1] with a star, a footnote[^2] with a dagger, and this
should be `monospace`.

## Subsection

> This is a quote block. It should be indented slightly and shouldn't
> contain a line break.

> | This is a quoted line block. It should be indented slightly

After this line there should be stars.

This is a new paragraph after the stars. This text is [Small
Caps]{.smallcaps}. Here is a pound sign (£), a euro sign (€), and three
letters with accents: ëóû.
